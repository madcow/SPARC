## General Project Structure

## Runtime Paths

### Global Files

The settings in /etc/gas.conf are overwritten by local
user settings. They provide default config values in
case the user has not set those values in their local
file (or the file do not exist and the program does not
have permissions to create it).

    /etc/gas.cfg
    /usr/gas/rom/

### User Files

Local user files are stored in ~/.local/.share/gas/.
Saves are packaged together for easier portability but
can be exported back into the exact same format as on
real hardware (to write on a memory card for example).

    save.bee
    conf.cfg
    rom/

TODO: Write Win32 path documentation.
