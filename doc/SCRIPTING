# Scripting

GAS can be used to quickly edit, categorize and sort
the users software archive. If the user has thumbnails
on a ftp server it can download the matching ones.

TODO: Command-line options.

# Shell interpreter

Gash shell interpreter allows the user to run multiple
GAS commands from any given script file without having
to prefix each of them with the program name. Just add
the following shabang to your GASH script:

    #!/usr/bin/gas -c
    set use_xinput  false  # This can also be used to
    set fullscreen  false  # make debugging shortcuts
    set width       1024
    set height      768

    boot /bios/sys.dat
    open /roms/rom.dat

# RC File

The .gasrc file is read before every execution and may
contain commands mostly for emulation setup. It has the
same format as the gash script above.
