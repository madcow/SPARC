# Firebee File Format

This part of the documentation again goes into fever
dream territory and you can safely just ignore it.

FIREBEE (which stands for Format for Integrated Runtime
Environments for Better Emulation Execution - I'm sorry
about the names) Files formatted in the firebee file
format end with the .bee extension.

# Header Description

short  type      // Valid range from 0xBEE0-0xBEEF.
short  flags     // Bitwise flags, compression, etc.
int32  checksum  // Optional contents checksum.
int32  unused    // Unused header field.
int32  offset    // File index offset.

# File Signature Types

Below is the range of valid firebee file signatures.
All numbers are listed in hexadecimal. Where do bees
live? In hexagons. It all comes together here.

0xBEE0  Unused
..      Unused
0xBEE9  Unused
0xBEEA  Archive
0xBEEB  Savegames
0xBEEC  Config backup
0xBEED  ROM Data backup
0xBEEE  Emulation Cores
0xBEEF  Emulation Tests

There can be one 0xBEEA archive to contain all types of
firebee files. So it is possible to export the library,
savegames, config and everything else as a single file.
